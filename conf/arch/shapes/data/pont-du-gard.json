		"before": [
			"Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, the son-in-law of Caesar Augustus, is responsible for the water supply of the Roman Empire. He has the problem of transporting water from a sprint at Uzès to the Roman colony Nîmes, about 12 miles away.",
			"Marcus plans to build the Nîmes aqueduct, which will traverse 31 miles of hills, rocky terrian, and rivers. The entire aqueduct can descend only 56 feet from beginning to end, less than two feet per mile.",
			"You are assigned to build the portion which will cross the Gordon River and descend a mere one inch over its 1000 foot span. "
		],
		"after": [
			"You have completed Pont du Gard! It will now carry 44 million gallons a day to the city of Nîmes.",
			"As Rome declines in the 4th century, the aqueduct will be neglected and debris will begin to accumulate, slowing the flow of water. Eventually, about 700 years after its construction, the aqueduct will fall out of use.",
			"Beginning in the 13th century, Pont du Gard will be repurposed as a toll bridge. It will continue to be used as a toll bridge until 1747, when the French will build a nearby bridge over the Gordon River dedicated to such traffic.",
			"Napoleon III will restore much of Pont du Gard in 1855."
